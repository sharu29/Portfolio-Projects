-- The Metropolitan Museum of Art

--  The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.
-- In this project, you will be working with a table named met that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.

-- Note: Data for this project was provided by CodeAcademy

-- Pre-Gaming for Aggregates

-- 1
-- Start by getting a feel for the met table:
SELECT *
FROM met
LIMIT 10;

-- 2
-- How many pieces are in the American Decorative Art collection?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM met;

-- 3
-- Celery was considered a luxurious snack in the Victorian era (around the 1800s). Wealthy families served stalks of it in intricate glass vases.

-- Count the number of pieces where the category includes ‘celery’.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';
--Look at the category names:
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM met
WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';

-- 4
-- Find the title and medium of the oldest piece(s) in the collection.

-- First, let’s find the “lowest” year:
SELECT MIN(date)
FROM met;

SELECT date, title, medium
FROM met
WHERE date LIKE '%1600%';
-- Betty Lamp, Candlestick, and Casement Window are among the oldest pieces in the collection.

-- 5
-- Not every American decoration is from the Americas… where are they are coming from?

-- Find the top 10 countries with the most pieces in the collection.
SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 6
-- There are all kinds of American decorative art in the Met’s collection.

-- Find the categories HAVING more than 100 pieces.
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;

-- 7
-- Lastly, let’s look at some bling!

-- Count the number of pieces where the medium contains ‘gold’ or ‘silver’.

-- And sort in descending order.
SELECT medium, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE medium LIKE '%gold%' OR medium LIKE '%silver%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- If we want to be more accurate, we can use a CASE statement:
SELECT CASE
  WHEN medium LIKE '%gold%' THEN 'Gold'
  WHEN medium LIKE '%silver' THEN 'Silver'
  ELSE NULL
  END AS 'Bling',
  COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE Bling IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- Silver - 293
-- Gold - 41
-- There are a lot of silver pieces
