-- RPA Customer Segmentation

-- The marketing department of Reputable Product Agency (RPA) is looking to segment the company users 
-- by a number of different criteria.

-- In this context, a segment is a subset of users that meet different conditions. 
-- Segments are used to send marketing campaigns to users who meet specific criteria 
-- or to measure the performance of specific marketing campaigns.

-- Use SQL queries to generate user lists for the marketing department. 
-- The users dataset is imported into the workspace.
